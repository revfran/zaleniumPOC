# zaleniumPOC
A zalenium executable test suite

# Test environment: Zalenium
Please view TestFramework.md for details

# Why this repository?
I just wanted to do something with Zalenium a long time ago. The idea to have a self-contained package with selenium, browser, webDrivers and additional features is reason enough to just give it a thought. I saw an usage example on "Execute Automation" and this framework seemed incredibly powerful.

# Test framework: python (unittest) selenium 
It is one of the simplest frameworks, as the test code here is not the purpose of this repo

# Output
Execution of tests leave a video on /tmp/videos, and an artifact is on this branch just as an example
